# jQuery AJAX Post

## Prerequisites

-   [http-study](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/http-study)
-   [json-study](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/json-study)

## Objectives

Make HTTP requests using `curl` and AJAX for:

-   Creating a specific resource.

## Preparation

Set up the client:

1.  [Fork and clone](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/meta/wiki/ForkAndClone)
    this repository.
1.  Create and checkout a new branch (training).
1.  Install dependencies with `npm install`.

We'll make requests of and receive responses from an HTTP server we'll set up
 together:

1.  Open a new terminal (window or tab).
1.  Change into `~/wdi/tmp/library-api`.
1.  Run the HTTP server with `rails server`.

We're now ready to make requests.

### Curl single book demonstration

We'll use curl to add a book. Watch as I add a script to my `curl/post.sh` file
and run it in my terminal.

### Curl single book code along

We'll use curl to add a book. Code along as I add a script to my `curl/post.sh`
file and run it in my terminal.

### Curl single book lab

Now write your own curl script in `curl/post.sh`.  Add a few books.

### AJAX single book demo and lab

Watch as I change the code in `index.html` and alter the javascript.

We'll be going back and forth between watching me and doing it yourself.
